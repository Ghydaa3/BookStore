# Automated Test Suite for Online Bookstore

## Description
This project contains an automated test suite for a sample online bookstore using Cypress. The tests cover basic functionalities such as viewing a list of books, adding books to the cart, updating the cart, and proceeding to checkout.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (for Cypress)
- Cypress
- A code editor (VS Code)


## Clone the repository

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ghydaa3/BookStore.git
    ```


2. Run the tests using Cypress:
    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```


## Site Selection
The site for this project was chosen based on the requirements outlined in the email, which mentioned a website for an online bookstore without specifying a particular site. I chose the online bookstore website [https://bookcart.azurewebsites.net/](https://bookcart.azurewebsites.net/) because it is simple and suitable for this task.

## Challenges
While working on automating the tests, I faced a challenge in selecting the appropriate selectors. Some elements on the website were not easy to target with the right selector, making it difficult to interact with certain elements in the automation. However, I was able to overcome this difficulty by using other attributes to identify the required elements.
